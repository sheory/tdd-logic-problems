## Caesar's Cipher Problem
<br>

### The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique

<hr />

### This method is based on a mono-alphabetic cipher and is also called a shift cipher or additive cipher. Julius Caesar used the shift cipher (additive cipher) technique to communicate with his officers. For this reason, the shift cipher technique is called the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a kind of replacement (substitution) cipher, where all letter of plain text is replaced by another letter.

### Formula:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encryption</b>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>`En (x) = (x + n) mod 26` </b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Decryption</b>

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>`Dn (x) = (xi - n) mod 26` </b>


#### Where:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E denotes the encryption
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D denotes the decryption
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x denotes the letters value
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n denotes the key value (shift value)

<hr />

### <b>Exemple: </b>
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; input: abc
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output: def
